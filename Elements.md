# Elements

Most of XI elements are wrappers around UITK elements. These elements simply use the UITK element state allowing for the XI API to be very familliar for those who already know UITK. Some elements have been created to add onto the default collection that Unity has to offer.

Visit an Element's page to view it's description, and it's associated fields and events.
