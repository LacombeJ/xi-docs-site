# XI - Extended Interface

A UI framework for building world space / XR interfaces with [Unity's UI Toolkit (UITK)](https://unity.com/features/ui-toolkit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

XI was made to bring world space support to UITK. Unlike the [older UI systems](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UI-system-compare.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} uGUI/IMGUI, which other VR UI assets utilize, UITK comes with a powerful set of tools like [UI Builder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIBuilder.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and an easy workflow for building modern UI with [UXML](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-UXML.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [USS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-USS.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. XI utilizes UITK's elements, layout engine, and the mentioned toolset to provide the same experience in building UI in 3D world space.
