# Renderer

## Standard Renderer
The core renderer of XI. This includes a lot of features such as:
- Shadergraph support
- High quality local antialiasing (even if AA is disabled in project)
- Linear gradient background rendering
- High quality TMP text rendering (with layout accuracy matching UITK)

## Shapes Renderer
This is a provided sample that features a renderer implementation using the Shapes asset.
- A lot of features are missing from shapes renderer but it serves a good example on how to implement your own renderer
